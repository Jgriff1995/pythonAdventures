# Python Basics

Welcome to my **Python Basics** repository! This is where I’m building a strong foundation in Python as I transition from Java to Python for interview preparation and problem-solving. 

### Why Python?
After reflecting on my earlier approaches in Java, I realized I was focusing too much on syntax and not enough on **programming patterns** and **problem-solving strategies**. Python, with its simplicity and readability, is helping me focus on what truly matters: understanding patterns, writing clean code, and thinking algorithmically.

This repository is a fresh start—a place to practice, learn, and grow. Whether it’s mastering loops, data structures, or algorithms, I’m committed to becoming a better programmer, one line of code at a time.

### What’s Inside?
- **Basics**: Core Python concepts, from loops to functions.
- **Practice**: Solutions to common interview questions and coding challenges.
- **Progress**: A journey of improvement, with each commit representing a step forward.
