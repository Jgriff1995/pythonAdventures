## About the Project

After reflecting on my earlier approaches in Java, I realized I was focusing too much on syntax and not enough on programming patterns and problem-solving strategies. Python, with its simplicity and readability, allows me to focus on what truly matters: understanding patterns, writing clean code, and thinking algorithmically.

This repository serves as a fresh startâ€”a place to practice, learn, and grow. Whether it's mastering loops, data structures, or algorithms, I'm committed to becoming a better programmer, one line of code at a time.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Intro_basic/**: Core Python concepts, from loops to functions.
- **examples/**: Practical examples and mini-projects to demonstrate Python applications.
- **leetcode/**: Solutions to common interview questions and coding challenges from LeetCode.
- **personal_projects/**: Individual projects exploring various Python applications.

## Getting Started
