def longestCommonPrefix(strs):

    Finds the longest common prefix among an array of strings.

    :type strs: List[str] - Input list of strings.

    Time Complexity: O(n * m) - Where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the shortest string.
    Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space, as we only store the result string.
